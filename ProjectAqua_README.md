# Welcome to ProjectAqua
# This is the ONLY ProjectAqua Repository, no other repos will be made.
# ProjectAqua uses multiple coding languages, it's hard to code here, so we made it easier for you.
# Oh and, do not ask any question on Issues, Pull Requests if you don't want to be ignored. The answer to your questions are in the file comments.
# Bye!
